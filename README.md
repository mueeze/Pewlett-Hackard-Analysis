# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
> This analysis was conducted to identify retiring employees among the total employee base and figure out to what extent these retiring employees can be re-employed under a mentorship program. 

## Results
> The results for this analysis sheds light on the following 
> - An overwhelming number of Senior Engineers (25916) and Senior Staff (24926) are retiring which will create a vacuum at the top. 
> - This can lead to internal promotions and in turn vacancies at the consecutive levels. 
> - Only 2 managers are retiring which means there isn't much change in the top management, which means age is not a determining factor for management roles. 
> - Only 2 percent of the total retiring employees are eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary
> A total of 72458 employees are retiring as part of the 'silver tsunami. Out of which only 1549 are eligible for mentorship program. This a problem for specific departments like Development and Production where the retirement rate is higher. We can say that there are not enough retirement ready employeed to mento the next generation employees. On the other hand though through promotion some of those voids can be fulfilled. 

> We can figure out what the reduction in salary expense is going to be after the 'silver tsunami'. In addition if we have a hiring and training expense table we can figure out what the cost of replacement is going to be for the retiring employee.
